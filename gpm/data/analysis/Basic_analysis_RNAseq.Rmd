# Method description

FASTQ files were generated using bcl2fastq (Illumina). To facilitate reproducible analysis, samples were processed using the publicly available nf-core/RNA-seq pipeline version 3.4 [@ewels2020nf] implemented in Nextflow 21.04.0 [@di2017nextflow] using Docker 20.10.8 [@merkel2014docker] with the minimal command. In brief, lane-level reads were trimmed using Trim Galore 0.6.7 [@felix_krueger_2021_5127899] and aligned to the `r method_des` using STAR 2.7.9a [@dobin2013star]. Gene-level assignment was then performed using featureCounts 1.6.457 [@liao2014featurecounts] and transcript-level quantification was done by Salmon v1.5.2 [@patro2017salmon]. All analysis was performed using custom scripts in R version 4.1.1 using the DESeq2 v.1.32.0 framework [@love2014moderated].
